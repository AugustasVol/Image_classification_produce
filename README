A project for classifying produce

Sample pictures in samples directory

images_dir_labels.py - preprocess function and class
train_test_splitter.py - splits data paths for testing and training, need to define a path in a file
cnn_keras.py - keras model function
trainer.py
tester.py
model_0.25_6 - model weights, 0.25 means picture scale, 6 means number of outputs

notebook_tester.ipynb - test the model visually with sample

data_paths - folder where train_test_splitter.py saves CSV files

Required libraries:
